## 📌 Overview

**FAQ Chatbot Assistant** is an interactive chatbot built with **Python**, **NLTK**, **Scikit-learn**, and **Streamlit**.
It leverages **TF-IDF vectorization** and **cosine similarity** to match user queries with the most relevant **Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)**, delivering instant answers in a sleek, **dark-mode UI**.

### What is an FAQ Chatbot? 🤔

An **FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) Chatbot** is a type of chatbot designed to **automatically answer common questions** for users.
Instead of manually searching through help articles, users can simply ask questions in natural language, and the chatbot retrieves the **most relevant answer** from a predefined FAQ database.

Typical use cases include:

* Customer support on e-commerce or service websites.
* Internal IT or HR support for employees.
* Educational platforms providing instant guidance to students.

**Benefits of an FAQ Chatbot:**

* ✅ Instant response for common queries
* ✅ Reduces human support workload
* ✅ Improves user experience
* ✅ Scales effortlessly for large FAQ datasets

This project is designed to demonstrate:

* 🔍 **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** basics (tokenization, stopwords removal)
* 🧠 **Information Retrieval** using TF-IDF + cosine similarity
* 🎨 **Modern UI/UX** with avatars, chat bubbles, and dark theme
* 🏗️ How to build a **deployable, production-ready chatbot** for real-world FAQs

---

## ✨ Features

✅ **Dark-themed UI** – professional, clean, and user-friendly
✅ **Chat-like experience** – avatars for both user and bot
✅ **Instant FAQ matching** – powered by TF-IDF & cosine similarity
✅ **Quick action buttons** – pre-defined common questions
✅ **Expandable FAQ dataset** – just add more Q&A pairs
✅ **Lightweight & fast** – no heavy ML model required
